# Homeless-System-Model
Compartmental model for projecting how resource changes will impact homelessness response systems.

## Version 1
Version 1 was developed in 2019. It was an early attempt to capture some of the dynamics of how people move through the homeless response system. The model includes the ability to add capacity to shelter and housing resources.

## Verstion 2

Version 2 is a rethinking of the model, which simplifies the flows substantially. The model uses stochastic differential equations to reflect real world uncertainty. This is a work in progress.

The code for the stochastic modeling was borrowed heavily from @smtowers and their excellent tutorial: http://sherrytowers.com/2016/02/06/stochastic-compartmental-modelling-with-stochastic-differential-equations-2/
